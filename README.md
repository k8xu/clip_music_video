## How to Generate a Music Video

We provide a Colab notebook to more easily run the code: [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1qVgnqV7uChEYqF3VKAcDuL1B2b54p0Lp?usp=sharing)

To run the code locally, follow these instructions:
1. Clone this GitHub repository using `git clone https://github.com/k8xu/music-video-generation.git`
2. TODO: Add intermediate steps
3. To watch the music video, we recommend that you upload the video to Google Drive or YouTube. QuickTime Player does not work for playing the video.
